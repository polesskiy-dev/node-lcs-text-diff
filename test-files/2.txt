The Way that can be told of is not the eternal Way;
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
The named is the mother of all things.

So we may see their subtlety,
So we may see their outcome.
The two are the same,
But after they are produced,
  they have different names.
They both may be called deep and profound.
Deeper and more profound,
The door of all subtleties!
